===============
Getting Started
===============

If you're new to Alyvix or Alyvix Server, read the `overview <introduction.html>`_ to
get up to speed.  When you're ready to use Alyvix Server, read the `install page <install.html>`_
and then configure your `sessions <session_management.html>`_ and optionally integrate Alyvix
Server into your `favorite monitoring system <monitoring_integrations.html>`_.

Once you've set everything up, you can `schedule your test cases <test_case_scheduling.html>`_ for
execution, explore your results via the `measurements API <measurement_web_apis.html>`_, and look
at reports that detail every step Alyvix Robot runs, whether successful or not.

If you're a visual learner, be sure to look at our `video tutorials <video_tutorials.html>`_,
also available on our `YouTube channel <video_tutorials.html>`_.
